Description: Here we simplify microarray analysis in the following steps:
	1. Import raw data, pheno data (metadata about the experiment), and feature data (probe information in HGNC symbol, for example),
	2. Perform technical and biological quality check,
	3. Perform data preprocessing before statistical methods,
	4. Perform statistical methods based on limma methodology,
	5. Perform GO and KEGG enrichment of differentially expressed genes.
